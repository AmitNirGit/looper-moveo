# Looper Task Moveo

This is my project for moveo,

while building this app it was important for me that anyone could look at my code and
easily understand it.
My goal for this project was to make a clean realistic, and cool looking UI that can be interacted immediately.

- In the deployed version the bonus is left out because with the time I had available I couldn't get the result I wanted, but the code of the main idea of how I wanted to implent the bonus task is there on \*bonus branch.

- this project was build using ReactJS.
- responsive for mobile & desktop

#Have fun exploring! :)
